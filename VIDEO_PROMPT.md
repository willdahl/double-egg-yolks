# Music Video Generation Prompt: "Double Egg Yolks"

## 🥚 THE CORE CONCEPT (MOST IMPORTANT)

**This video celebrates a MIRACLE.**

A 25-year-old man named Ryan cracks ONE egg while making breakfast in his Brooklyn kitchen. Instead of the expected single yolk, **TWO GOLDEN YOLKS** fall into the frying pan from one shell.

This mundane breakfast moment becomes a transcendent revelation. Ryan responds with genuine wonder, tears of joy, cosmic questioning, and celebratory awe—treating this unexpected double yolk as a profound miracle.

**The visual motif - "The Crack":**
One egg cracks → one egg white flows → **TWO YOLKS** fall into pan side-by-side

**This motif repeats ~8 times throughout the video** - every time the lyrics say "Double Egg Yolks."

**The theme:** An emotional response to a MIRACLE when mundanity would otherwise be expected. Not "something mundane treated as profound" but "something genuinely wonderful discovered in an ordinary moment."

Inspired by the **"Double Rainbow" viral video** - genuine, tearful celebration of unexpected beauty. Ryan's sincerity IS the piece. He's not performing—he's genuinely moved.

**Video Length:** 2:50 total (2:36 song + 14 seconds post-song peaceful ending)

## Critical Coherence Requirements

### ⚠️ PROTAGONIST (MUST STAY ABSOLUTELY CONSISTENT)

**Ryan**: 25-year-old male
- **Appearance**: Casual morning clothes (gray or neutral t-shirt, comfortable pants/pajama bottoms)
- **NOT disheveled or sloppy** - just normal morning energy, relatable
- **Build**: Average, casual, genuine
- **Hair**: Normal, maybe slightly tousled from morning (NOT progressively messy)
- **Expression range**: Calm → Surprised → Awestruck → Tearfully joyful → Contemplative → Peaceful
- **SAME PERSON, SAME FACE, SAME CLOTHING** for entire 2:50 runtime

**This is the #1 coherence requirement.** The protagonist must be visually identical in every shot. Use consistent character model/reference.

---

### ⚠️ SETTING (MUST STAY ABSOLUTELY CONSISTENT)

**Brooklyn kitchen apartment:**
- **Size**: Small, cozy but not cramped
- **Backsplash**: White subway tiles
- **Counter**: Wooden or light-colored countertop
- **Stove**: Gas stove with visible blue flame
- **Window**: Single window with natural morning light
- **Background elements**:
- Coffee maker on counter
- Delivery magnets on fridge
- Succulent plant on windowsill (gradual transformation - see below)
- Mismatched mugs

**SAME KITCHEN LAYOUT** for entire video. No location changes. Camera angles can vary, but the physical space stays identical.

---

### ⚠️ HERO PROPS (TRACK THROUGHOUT)

1. **The Double Yolks in Pan** (appears ~15+ times): Two golden yolks side-by-side in black non-stick frying pan
2. **Egg & Egg Shell**: The cracking egg, broken shell halves
3. **Frying Pan**: Black non-stick pan, consistent scratches/wear
4. **Smartphone**: Ryan's phone (iPhone or generic), used for documentation/photos

### ⚠️ TERMINOLOGY NOTE

**Always use PLURAL: "Double Egg Yolks"**
Never "Double Egg Yolk" (singular). The song title, lyrics, and all references should be plural. This applies to any on-screen text, graphics, captions, or visual elements that might include the phrase.

---

## 🥚 THE CORE VISUAL MOTIF (MOST IMPORTANT)

### **"The Crack" - One Egg = Two Yolks**

**This is the #1 visual element of the entire video.**

**The motif:** Ryan cracks ONE egg → one egg white flows out → **TWO GOLDEN YOLKS** fall and land side-by-side in the frying pan.

**When it appears:**
Every time the lyrics say **"Double Egg Yolks"** (~8 times throughout song), show this visual motif:
- Either as the **action happening** (Ryan cracking the egg live)
- Or as a **visual echo/replay** (memory/flashback of the crack)
- Or as the **static result** (two yolks in pan, glowing)

**Critical shots featuring the motif:**
- Shot 3 : The FIRST crack - the revelation
- Shot 10 : Chorus - replay/echo of the crack
- Shot 24 : Second chorus - replay/echo
- Shot 29 : Bridge contemplation
- Shot 33 : Bridge climax - the crack as visual memory, reverent
- Shot 35 : Final chorus - replay
- Shot 41 [2:31]: Final image of song - the yolks glowing

**Visual consistency for the motif:**
- Black non-stick frying pan
- One egg white (clear/translucent)
- TWO yolks (golden yellow, glistening, symmetrical)
- Slow-motion for key revelation moments
- Glowing/radiant treatment as intensity builds

---

## Visual Style Guidelines

### **Color Palette & Progression (Critical for Narrative)**

This is a **color journey** that tracks Ryan's emotional arc:

** Intro - Natural Morning**
- Neutral tones, natural kitchen lighting
- Slightly desaturated, ordinary reality
- Succulent: slightly wilted (background detail)

** Verse 1 - Wonder Begins**
- +10-25% yellow saturation gradual increase
- Warm golden glow beginning
- Light catches on yolks, creating radiance

** First Chorus - Celebration**
- +30% yellow saturation
- Golden glow throughout kitchen
- Yolks appear radiant, luminous

** Verse 2 - Tears & Peak Emotion**
- +35% saturation
- Dramatic rim-lighting on Ryan's tears
- Warm kitchen glow, emotional peak

** Second Chorus - Sustained Joy**
- +40% saturation
- Maximum golden glow for chorus sections
- Succulent noticeably greener (background)

** Bridge - Cosmic Contemplation**
- Soft **rainbow hints** introduced (on yolk edges, in lighting)
- +40% yellow base maintained
- Mystical, reverent lighting

** Final Chorus - Transcendent**
- Maximum golden saturation
- Rainbow glow throughout kitchen (subtle, not overpowering)
- Succulent now VIBRANT green (background transformation complete)
- Everything bathed in warm light

**[2:36-2:50] Ending - Peace**
- Gradual return to natural warm lighting
- Soft, gentle
- Yolk reflections in Ryan's eyes remain golden

**⚠️ AI Video Generation Note:**
Color/lighting shifts should be **GRADUAL across 2:50 runtime**. Avoid sudden jumps or uncanny morphing. The change is smooth, organic, almost imperceptible shot-to-shot.

---

### **Camera Style - MTV Music Video Pacing**

**Shot Length Guidelines:**
- **Intro**: 3-8 seconds (establishing, anticipation)
- **Verses**: 3-5 seconds (discovery, documentation, emotion)
- **Choruses**: 3-4 seconds (celebration, quick cuts)
- **Bridge**: 2-4 seconds (contemplative, daydream inserts brief)
- **Final Chorus**: 3-5 seconds (sustained celebration)
- **Ending**: 2-5 seconds (peaceful, slow zoom on eyes)

**Camera Movements:**
- **Static shots** for contemplative moments (Ryan gazing, wondering)
- **Slow zooms** for emotional beats (tears, smile, eyes)
- **Gentle tracking** for following Ryan's movement
- **Handheld** for phone POV and excited documentation
- **Overhead** for pan shots showing the yolks
- **Slow-motion** for the egg-cracking motif key moments
- **Dolly/crane** for Bridge visual climax

**Avoid:**
- Spinning/rotating cameras
- Whip pans or smash cuts (use cuts, dissolves)
- Chaotic shaky-cam (only slight handheld for phone POV)

---

### **Lighting Progression**

**Natural Morning → Golden Glow → Rainbow Cosmic → Natural Warm**

**Key Lighting Moments:**
- First yolk reveal - golden glow begins
- First chorus - warm saturation increase
- Tears moment - **dramatic rim-light/side-light** catching tears beautifully
- Bridge - **soft rainbow hints** on yolk edges, mystical quality
- Final chorus - maximum golden glow, rainbow throughout kitchen
- [2:44] Eyes close-up - golden yolk reflections visible in pupils

**Lighting Technique:**
- Use **practical lighting** where possible (window light, overhead kitchen light, gas flame)
- **Gradual saturation increase** in post-production, not sudden changes
- **Rainbow hints** should be subtle - edge lighting, soft glow, NOT full rainbow beams
- **Rim-lighting** for tears to catch light dramatically

---

## Narrative Arc (MAINTAIN THIS EMOTIONAL PROGRESSION)

The video is an **emotional journey**, not a plot:

1. ** Mundane Routine** - Ryan making breakfast, calm, ordinary
2. ** Discovery** - Cracks egg, sees two yolks, surprise
3. ** Wonder** - Gazing, phone documentation, singing begins
4. ** Celebration** - First chorus, joy and awe, contemplating luck/fate/hope
5. ** Sharing** - Calls mom, seeks validation
6. ** Emotional Peak** - Tears of joy, singing to ceiling, overwhelmed
7. ** Sustained Joy** - Second chorus, celebration continues
8. ** Cosmic Contemplation** - Bridge, visions/daydreams, sincere questioning
9. ** Transcendent Celebration** - Final chorus, maximum joy, completion
10. **[2:36-2:50] Peaceful Satisfaction** - Sits to eat, satisfied smile, eyes reflecting yolks, fade to black

**⚠️ This arc must be maintained.** Each stage flows into the next. Ryan's emotional state evolves continuously.

## Background Transformation (Subtle, Gradual)

### **The Succulent Plant Journey**

**Purpose:** Shows the kitchen itself responding to the wonder, but as a **background detail**, not a focal point.

**Progression:**
- **** Slightly wilted, ordinary
- **** Noticeably greener, perking up
- **** VIBRANT green, small flower blooming (peak transformation)
- **[2:36-2:50]** Remains vibrant (transformation complete)

**⚠️ Critical AI Video Note:**
This should be a **SUBTLE, GRADUAL change** across 2:50. NOT sudden morphing. The succulent should look like it's responding to the golden light and joy in the kitchen, growing naturally. Avoid uncanny/frenetic AI transformation artifacts.

**Other background transformations (all subtle):**
- Kitchen lighting: natural → golden glow
- Window light: soft → warm → rainbow-tinged
- Overall color saturation: neutral → maximum warm yellow

**What should NOT change:**
- Kitchen structure/layout
- Appliances, tiles, counter (physical objects stay consistent)
- Ryan's face, body, clothing (SAME character)

---

## Critical Coherence Instructions for Video Generation

### **Character Consistency (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**

Use a **consistent character model/reference** for Ryan across ALL 46 shots:
- Same face structure, features, skin tone
- Same hair (casual, not drastically changing)
- Same clothing (t-shirt color and style, same pants)
- Same body type and build

**If the video generation service allows character reference images, provide ONE consistent reference for Ryan to use across all shots.**

### **Setting Consistency**

Kitchen layout must remain **spatially identical**:
- White subway tile backsplash always in same position
- Gas stove always in same location
- Window always same size/position
- Counter, fridge, cabinets - consistent placement

**Camera angles can vary, but the physical space is fixed.**

### **The Motif Execution**

Every time you see **"🥚 THE MOTIF"** in the storyboard:
- Show egg cracking animation
- One egg white flows
- TWO yolks fall into pan
- Black non-stick pan
- Slight slow-motion for key reveals
- Consistent yolk color (golden yellow)

**This visual must be recognizable and consistent** each time it appears.

### **Gradual Changes (Avoid Uncanny AI Artifacts)**

**Safe gradual changes:**
- ✅ Lighting shifts (natural → golden)
- ✅ Color saturation increase (gradual +5-10% per section)
- ✅ Succulent: wilted → greener → vibrant (background, slow)

**Avoid sudden morphing:**
- ❌ Objects suddenly transforming
- ❌ Kitchen layout changing
- ❌ Protagonist's face/body morphing
- ❌ Jarring color jumps

**Specify in generation prompt:** "Gradual lighting and color shifts across 2:50 runtime. Subtle background plant transformation. NO sudden object morphing or uncanny changes."

## Summary: What Makes This Video Work

1. **The Motif**: One egg → two yolks. Shown ~8 times. The core visual miracle.
2. **Ryan's Sincerity**: He's genuinely moved, not playing a character. His wonder is real.
3. **Color Journey**: Natural → golden → rainbow → peace. Tracks his emotional arc.
4. **Gradual Transformation**: Kitchen and succulent respond to the wonder (subtle, not chaotic).
5. **Tears of Joy**: Ryan cries genuinely, beautifully lit - Double Rainbow homage.
6. **Daydreams**: Brief visions showing his contemplations (luck/fate/hope/chickens/superhero/lottery).
7. **Peaceful Ending**: Sits to eat, satisfied smile, yolks reflected in eyes, fade to black, silence.

**The joke IS the sincerity.** Ryan treating a double egg yolk with cosmic significance, and meaning it—that's the whole piece.
